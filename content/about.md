I’m Joao Oliveira, a Senior Software Engineer with 7 years of experience dedicated to architecting and delivering high-performance, scalable systems. My core background is in C#/.NET, and my experience as a full-stack engineer (Angular/JavaScript) helps me keep a practical end-to-end view from product needs to production operations.

I specialize in System Design and building resilient architectures using Microservices, Message Brokers (Kafka, SNS, SQS), and Cloud infrastructure (AWS/Docker). I'm a firm believer in the "Test-Driven" mindset, utilizing xUnit for unit/integration testing and JMeter for performance benchmarking to ensure mission-critical stability.

Areas of focus

- Data & caching: SQL (PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server) and NoSQL (MongoDB); Redis for distributed caching and performance tuning.
- DevOps & observability: CI/CD automation and operational visibility with tools such as Kibana and Splunk.
- Architecture & design: scalability, clean code, and pragmatic design patterns for high-traffic systems.

Education

- Bachelor’s in Information Systems
- Post-graduate specialization in IT Governance
- MBA in Leadership and Innovation.

I enjoy tackling complex architectural problems and sharing what I learn through technical writing and mentoring. I care about engineering quality and leadership that translates into software that is reliable today and scalable tomorrow.
