I’m Joao Oliveira, a Senior Software Engineer with 7 years of experience dedicated to architecting and delivering high-performance, scalable systems. While my core expertise lies in the C#/.NET ecosystem, my background as a FullStack Developer (Angular/JavaScript) allows me to maintain a comprehensive view of the entire software lifecycle.

I specialize in System Design and building resilient architectures using Microservices, Message Brokers (Kafka, SNS, SQS), and Cloud infrastructure (AWS/Docker). I am a firm believer in the "Test-Driven" mindset, utilizing xUnit for unit/integration testing and JMeter for performance benchmarking to ensure mission-critical stability.

Technical Strategy & Stack:

- Databases & Caching: Expert knowledge in SQL (PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server) and NoSQL (MongoDB), leveraging Redis for distributed caching and performance optimization.
- DevOps & Observability: Building automated pipelines and monitoring system health through Kibana and Splunk.
- Architecture & Design: Focused on scalability, clean code, and robust System Design patterns to support high-traffic environments.
- Academic Background: Bachelor’s in Information Systems, Post-grad in IT Governance, and an MBA in Leadership and Innovation.

I am passionate about solving complex architectural challenges and sharing those insights through technical writing and team mentorship. I believe that technical excellence and strategic leadership are the keys to building software that doesn't just work, but scales.
